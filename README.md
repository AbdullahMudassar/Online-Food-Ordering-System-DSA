# Online-Food-Ordering-System-DSA
C++ project for Online Food Ordering System using data structures (BST, Queue, Stack, Linked List)
Online Food Ordering System (DSA Project)

This project was developed as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course.
It simulates an online food ordering system using C++ and multiple core data structures.
